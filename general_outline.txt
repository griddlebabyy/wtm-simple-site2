Create a clean website that lists the bars in bars.json by location (Strip, Downtown, Niche). Each page should have its own block under the location type, and inside should show a preview of the deals of that day. when you click on the bar, it opens a dedicated page where more information is shown (logo, address, deals, special events, etc.)

Use the style described in styles.txt for colors and theme. Deal information can be found in deals.json and bar names and slug can be found in bars.json.

Schema outline can be found in schema outline.txt

Stack:

Website: react
Backend: supabase
